## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **User Type Detection Logic:**
```swift
// Enhanced detection with 6 user types and combination logic
// Priority order: StudentEntrepreneur → Student → Entrepreneur → Investor → Mentor → CommunityBuilder

// Student Entrepreneur (specific combination)
if interests.contains("student") && (interests.contains("entrepreneur") || 
   interests.contains("start your business")) → .studentEntrepreneur

// Individual types
if interests.contains("student") → .student
if interests.contains("start your business") → .entrepreneur  
if interests.contains("invest") → .investor
if interests.contains("share knowledge") → .mentor
if interests.contains("be part of the community") → .communityBuilder
// Default: .communityBuilder
```

### **Tutorial Triggering:**
```swift
// Page19.swift - When user clicks "Continue to Circl"
func triggerTutorialAndNavigate() {
    let onboardingData = gatherOnboardingData()
    TutorialManager.shared.detectAndSetUserType(from: onboardingData)
    UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "just_completed_onboarding")
    // Navigate to PageForum → Tutorial starts automatically
}
```

### **Enhanced Tutorial Management:**
```swift
// TutorialModels.swift - New method for flexible tutorial starting
func startTutorialForUserType(_ userType: UserType) {
    // Force start tutorial for any user type (used in settings)
    var completedFlows = getCompletedFlows()
    completedFlows.remove(userType.rawValue)  // Clear completion status
    
    // Start tutorial immediately
    currentFlow = getTutorialFlow(for: userType)
    currentStepIndex = 0
    tutorialState = .inProgress(stepIndex: 0)
    isShowingTutorial = true
}
```

### **Data Storage:**
```swift
// Page3.swift - Stores selections after successful registration
UserDefaults.standard.set(selectedUsageInterest, forKey: "selected_usage_interest")
UserDefaults.standard.set(selectedIndustryInterest, forKey: "selected_industry_interest")

// Page5.swift - Stores location after successful submission  
UserDefaults.standard.set(location, forKey: "user_location")
```
