    func showPaywall(for userType: UserType) {
        // Instantly show full-screen paywall with background
        subscriptionState = .showingBackground
        isShowingPaywall = true
        
        // Show content after 0.6s (user absorption time)
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.6) {
            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.4)) {
                self.subscriptionState = .showingContent

        }
    }
}
```

    // ... other user types
    }
}
```
